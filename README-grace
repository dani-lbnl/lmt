If I am very lucky I will be able to develop and build on Compiler and
the libraries will just work on the Grace OSSs. The versions of CentOS
are off by one, and the kerenels differ by build numbers, but are
otherwise the same. The architectures are the same. There's hope.

I'll do all the development in the 'rpc-stats' branch rather than in
the main code-base.

git branch rpc-stats
git checkout rpc-stats
[or equiv. the one command git checkout -b rpc-stats]
and 
git checkout master
to go back and
git merge rpc-stats
git branch -d rpc-stats
to pull in the changes and delete the branch.

In order to have a new module I'll need to register the new module
with the build system. In the directory

  cerebro/metric

the Makefile.am lists the modules that will be built. So copying the
lines:

modulelib_LTLIBRARIES = \
	cerebro_metric_lmt_ost.la \

and

cerebro_metric_lmt_ost_la_SOURCES = ost.c
cerebro_metric_lmt_ost_la_LDFLAGS = $(module_ldflags)
cerebro_metric_lmt_ost_la_LIBADD = $(common_libadd)

and using the new name cerebro_metric_lmt_rpc.la may be enough to get
things going. It will have a dependence on rpc.c. If I need support
code from other files I may need to update them as well. If I can make
the changes entirely stand-alone, that might be a good thing for a
start.

I may want to add the rpc metric option to the lmtmetric.c utility as
well as the libraries.

By analogy with the lmt_ost metric I want the lmt_rpc metric to build
on calls to liblmt, which means there needs to be an rpc.c and rpc.h
in the liblmt directory and the Makefile.am there needs these
modifications:

liblmt_la_SOURCES = \
        ost.c \
        ost.h \
        rpc.c \
        rpc.h \
...

The entire diff for ost.c to rpc.c in the cerebro/metric is:

all the really interesting new code will be in liblmt/rpc.c and
rpc.h.
